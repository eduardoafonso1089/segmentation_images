# BemAgro Challenge - Image Segmentation for Vegetation Detection

## Description

This repository contains the solution for the image segmentation challenge for vegetation detection proposed by BemAgro. The challenge is divided into four main stages:

1. Processing large images and preparing data for use in AI model training and inference.
2. Preparing a dataset for training an AI model for image segmentation.
3. Training a neural network model.
4. Performing inference using the trained model.

By the end of this project, we will have a trained neural network model to segment images and detect vegetation, essentially replicating the image binarization method.

## The Model

The model is too large to save in this repository, so it is stored on the drive. Please click on the link to download it.

## The Results

The results of the challenge were saved in the repository just to prove the achievement; however, this is not recommended in a real project.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eduardoafonso1089/segmentation_images.git
    ```
2. Install the requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Execute the stages as described in the PDF file.
